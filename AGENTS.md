This file is the workflow reference for coding agents and maintainers. It should be read after [README.md](README.md), [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md), and the task-specific docs for the area being changed.

## Project Workflow Rules

- Every non-merged PR-sized item recorded in `BACKLOG.md` must include a branch path, Git status, and PR link. Historical merged entries do not require branch-path backfills.
- Use branch paths in the form `<type>/<scope>-<short-description>` with lowercase ASCII letters, numbers, and hyphens only after the slash.
- Allowed branch path types are `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, and `chore`.
- Use `feat/` for new behavior, `fix/` for defect correction, `refactor/` for behavior-preserving structural or performance work, `docs/` for documentation-only changes, and `chore/` for build, CI, test-only, style, dependency, or repository-maintenance work.
- The branch path type must reflect the primary PR purpose. The PR title and final squash subject must use the most precise compatible Conventional Commit type.
- Every open PR series in `BACKLOG.md` must end with an explicit `Series Completion Gate` that references [GATES.md](GATES.md) for the current required pre-merge and post-merge quality gates.
- Do not merge any branch or pull request into `main` unless the maintainer explicitly requests that `main` merge in the current task.
- When continuing backlog or UI work without an explicit `main` merge request, create, push, and publish stacked PR branches, then leave them open for later landing.
- UI work must stay on the active UI branch stack until the maintainer asks to land it. Base each follow-up UI branch on the previous UI branch, and run `docker compose --env-file .env.local up --build --watch web` from the active branch so local Docker shows the current UI stack state.
- If Compose watch is unavailable during UI stack work, run `uv run portfell-compose-web-watch` from the active branch as the local Docker rebuild fallback.
- Use `Branch: <type>/<scope>-<short-description>` until a planned branch is created, then keep the exact published branch path in the backlog entry.
- Use `Git status: not started` and `PR: TBD` until work begins.
- Replace `PR: TBD` with the pull request URL once the PR exists.
- Update the Git status as work moves through planned, in progress, pushed, merged, or blocked.
- PR approval, required checks, auto-merge, shard layout, coverage threshold, and squash-subject validation are documented in [GATES.md](GATES.md).
- PR titles must follow `type(optional-scope): subject` because the title becomes the squash-merge commit subject.

## Generated Risk Context

This section is generated from recurring themes in first-parent `git log`.

Update command:

```bash
uv run python scripts/update_project_history_docs.py
```

Risk review rules:

- Update risks when commits introduce or retire operational, data correctness, or architecture risks.
- Prefer concrete mitigations that map to tests, logs, contracts, or docs.
- Keep stale risks only if the mitigation still needs active attention.

## R001. Exchange API reliability can silently reduce historical completeness

Status: Active

Signal: Deribit route errors, retry behavior, and long-running trade backfills appear repeatedly in the history.

Mitigation: Keep debug logs, checkpoint keys, deterministic windows, and completeness reports aligned before changing bronze execution.

Evidence:

- 2026-07-10 `ccb6962` Merge pull request #72 from SergejSchweizer/codex/pr15-recent-trade-snapshot-silver
- 2026-07-04 `ca0e922` Rename option trades dataset to options_trades
- 2026-07-04 `11da15c` Rename options trades and perps OHLCV datasets
- 2026-07-03 `4393c40` Rename perpetual trades dataset
- 2026-07-01 `f55d766` [codex] Extract OHLCV symbol bronze planning (#46)
- 2026-06-29 `7232cc4` Extract bronze head gap planning (#42)

## R002. Dataset naming drift can break Bronze, Silver, and Gold joins

Status: Active

Signal: Dataset names have changed over time, including volatility cleanup and explicit OHLCV dataset naming.

Mitigation: Rename work must update registry specs, lake paths, contracts, CLI choices, manifests, tests, and docs in one change.

Evidence:

- 2026-07-10 `8902f6b` Merge pull request #77 from SergejSchweizer/codex/pr18-gold-regime-feature-contract
- 2026-07-09 `c43e3e3` Merge pull request #58 from SergejSchweizer/codex/pr01-silver-contract-registry-baseline
- 2026-07-04 `ca0e922` Rename option trades dataset to options_trades
- 2026-07-04 `ab5543d` Rename open_interest dataset to open interest
- 2026-07-04 `11da15c` Rename options trades and perps OHLCV datasets
- 2026-07-03 `c9d39e1` Rename spot_ohlcv OHLCV dataset

## R003. Large refactors can blur architecture boundaries

Status: Active

Signal: The log contains many extraction commits across loader, lake, Silver, and Gold services.

Mitigation: Keep dependency direction and side effects explicit; verify with architecture/import checks and focused regression tests.

Evidence:

- 2026-07-04 `ba93394` Add architecture documentation
- 2026-07-01 `4e203fb` [codex] Complete Bronze refactor stack (#51)
- 2026-07-01 `f55d766` [codex] Extract OHLCV symbol bronze planning (#46)
- 2026-07-01 `a2287a1` Align architecture and coverage refactor gates
- 2026-07-01 `a674417` Consolidate refactor boundary work
- 2026-06-29 `febd87e` Extract silver volatility transformation (#45)

## R004. Coverage and strict typing can drift after broad edits

Status: Active

Signal: Quality-gate commits show that type coverage and test coverage are active project risks.

Mitigation: Run focused tests first, then full pytest, Ruff, and type checks before merging behavior or boundary changes.

Evidence:

- 2026-07-10 `850150b` Add GitHub quality gate script
- 2026-07-10 `c0fca84` Sync stacked PR validation policy
- 2026-07-09 `2a57684` Extend volatility medallion coverage
- 2026-07-01 `225a01e` Update README coverage statistics
- 2026-07-01 `a2287a1` Align architecture and coverage refactor gates
- 2026-06-27 `931263d` Align validation gates (#17)

## R005. Documentation snapshots can become stale relative to the lake

Status: Active

Signal: README coverage statistics and missing-day details have been refreshed several times.

Mitigation: Regenerate or explicitly date coverage snapshots when lake content, dataset names, or coverage reporting changes.

Evidence:

- 2026-07-01 `225a01e` Update README coverage statistics
- 2026-06-29 `60fcfcb` Remove README missing-day detail label
- 2026-06-29 `0d1ce23` Fix README table of contents
- 2026-06-28 `660f9f2` Deduplicate README table of contents
- 2026-06-26 `40cc90e` Merge branch 'codex/docs-update-missing-values'
- 2026-05-25 `b8b5b82` Refine raw dataset docs and Deribit endpoint sections (#7)

## UI changes

Read `docs/ui/page-development.md` before adding or changing a React page. Keep `apps/web/src/routes.tsx`, the page component, its `docs/ui/windows/<route-slug>.md` specification, typed API contracts, and regression tests synchronized in the same pull request. Do not add compatibility renderers or browser-owned financial, ingestion, authentication, or authorization logic.
