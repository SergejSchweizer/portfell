# Hosted Readiness

Last reviewed: 2026-07-19

This document is evidence for `docs/security/hosted_readiness.json`. The JSON file is the machine-readable gate input; this file explains the decisions in operational language.

## EODHD Storage And Derived Display Rights

Public-hosted mode may store only data fetched through a user-provided EODHD credential and may expose derived views only to users whose immutable entitlement snapshot includes the source observations. Provider redistribution and display rights must be reviewed again before public-hosted mode is enabled for external users.

## Personal License Boundary

Portfell does not pool one maintainer-owned provider key for all users. Each hosted user supplies their own provider credential, and provider calls resolve the credential only at request time through the encrypted vault.

## Shared Physical Deduplication

Shared observations and analytical artifacts may be physically deduplicated, but physical presence never grants visibility. User access is always resolved through user grants, immutable snapshots, and analysis-run ownership.

## User Key Backed Grants

No observation becomes visible to a user until a successful provider run using that user's active credential returns the observation and publishes a user grant.

## Retention And Account Deletion

Account deletion removes user grants, current snapshot pointers, projects, selections, analysis references, and hosted API state. Shared physical observations may remain only as unowned cache material unless a separate legal retention policy requires removal.

## GDPR Rights And Country Coverage

Privacy requests require identity verification, scoped export of user-owned records, deletion of user-owned state, and a country-specific review before public-hosted operation expands beyond the initially approved geography.

## Audit Retention And Incident Response

Hosted audit events must use redacted structured fields, exclude provider keys and tokens, and be retained only for the approved operational period. Incident response must include credential revocation, session revocation, key rotation, and user notification review.

## Encrypted Backups And Restore Drills

Database and shared-store backups must be encrypted. Backup ciphertext and KEK recovery material are stored separately. Restore drills must prove that missing KEK versions fail closed rather than exporting decrypted provider keys.

## KEK Recovery And Rotation

Credential KEKs are external runtime secrets. Rotation rewraps credentials without logging plaintext. Recovery material is separated from database/shared-store backups and must not enter Git, images, CI, logs, or browser storage.

## Database Role Review

Hosted persistence uses least-privilege roles and row-level security for user-owned tables. API access is through repository boundaries, not direct browser or Web-container database access.

## No Automatic Broker Execution

Portfell may produce broker-ready order files and recommendations, but hosted mode must not place broker orders automatically. Human approval remains outside the hosted API execution boundary.
