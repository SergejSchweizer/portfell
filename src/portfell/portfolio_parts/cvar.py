"""Pure-Python historical Minimum CVaR solver (PR61's remaining scope).

Implements the Rockafellar-Uryasev (2000) reformulation of historical
Conditional Value-at-Risk minimization: for `T` historical return scenarios
and confidence level `alpha`,

    CVaR_alpha(w) = min_zeta [ zeta + (1 / ((1-alpha)*T)) * sum_t max(0, -r_t.w - zeta) ]

is convex and piecewise-linear (non-smooth) in `(w, zeta)` jointly. The
repository has no numerical/LP dependency (pyarrow only), so this module
hand-implements a projected subgradient descent solver with a diminishing
step size and best-iterate tracking -- the standard approach for non-smooth
convex optimization when no closed-form or off-the-shelf LP solver is
available, matching the pure-Python precedent set by
`portfell.portfolio_parts.solvers` (projected gradient descent) and
`portfell.portfolio_parts.clustering` (hierarchical clustering).

Per the "Architecture Ownership" principle in
`docs/backlog/00-critical-correctness-priority-queue.md`, this real
implementation lives in a `portfolio_parts` module rather than being
dynamically re-imported from the `portfell.portfolio` facade.
